description: An illustration to write the contract logic using rust
---

# Hello World

To execute `rust` code on the Ontology blockchain, there's a process that needs to be followed. The steps are carried out in the following way:

1. `WASM` bytecode is generated by compiling the code.
2. The bytecode is deployed on to the chain.
3. Functions from the contract are invoked.

We will approach the development process from two different angles. We will first look at a template designed with the specific goal of getting you acquainted with the fundamentals of writing a `WASM` smart contract. And then, we will proceed to demonstrating how to start writing code from scratch.

To facilitate developers looking to work on Ontology `WASM` smart contracts we have made available a `rust` template that developers can clone and start editing to speed things up. The code can be cloned from Github using the following command-

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ontio/rust-wasm-contract-template.git
```

## Project file hierarchy

The file hierarchy of the project is mapped below.

```rust
.
├── .cargo
│   └── config
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.sh
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

The `config` file in `.cargo` directory contains the configuration settings which will be used when compiling the contract. The contents of the file-

```bash
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = [
	"-C", "link-args=-z stack-size=32768"
]
```

`[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]` is the compile target. The target will directly be compiled to `WASM` using the low-level virtual machine \(LLVM\) back end. The resultant bytecode can be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows system platforms. `rustflags` is used to configure the link arguments and the default stack size to 32768 bytes, 32KB that is. This indicates the highest stack value that the contract is allowed to use.

`cargo.toml` file contains a few configuration settings and other details regarding the contract. The content is as follows-

```yaml
[package]
name = "rust-wasm-contract-template"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["laizy <aochyi@126.com>"]
edition = "2018"

#See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"] #Compile as a dynamic link library

[dependencies]
