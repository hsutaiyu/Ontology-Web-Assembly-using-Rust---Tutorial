description: An illustration to write the contract logic using rust

# Hello World

To execute `rust` code on the Ontology blockchain, there's a process that needs to be followed. The steps are carried out in the following way:

1. `WASM` bytecode is generated by compiling the code.
2. The bytecode is deployed on to the chain.
3. Functions from the contract are invoked.

We will approach the development process from two different angles. We will first look at a template designed with the specific goal of getting you acquainted with the fundamentals of writing a `WASM` smart contract. And then, we will proceed to demonstrating how to start writing code from scratch.

To facilitate developers looking to work on Ontology `WASM` smart contracts we have made available a `rust` template that developers can clone and start editing to speed things up. The code can be cloned from Github using the following command-

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ontio/rust-wasm-contract-template.git
```

The file hierarchy of the project is mapped below.

```rust
.
├── .cargo
│   └── config
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.sh
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

The config file in .cargo directory contains the configuration settings which will be used when compiling the contract. The contents of the file-

```bash
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = [
	"-C", "link-args=-z stack-size=32768"
]
```
