description: An illustration to write the contract logic using rust

# Hello World

To execute `rust` code on the Ontology blockchain, there's a process that needs to be followed. The steps are carried out in the following way:

1. `WASM` bytecode is generated by compiling the code.
2. The bytecode is deployed on to the chain.
3. Functions from the contract are invoked.

We will approach the development process from two different angles. We will first look at a template desingned with the specific goal of getting you acquainted with the fundamentals of writing a `WASM` smart contract. And then, we will proceed to writing code from scratch.
