description: WASM development using the Ontology platform

# Getting Started

Ontology's Web Assembly based \(`WASM`\) contracts support development in `Rust` and `C++`. In this tutorial, we will focus on `native` smart contract development using `Rust`.

This simple walkthrough aims at allowing developers who are just getting started with building WASM contracts. The guide will help you with installing the development environment and then slowly move towards the development process.

The tutorial does follow a sequence, but feel free to navigate through the different sections based on your requirements.
